# Progress log

## 2026-11-02

- Reset the local repository to upstream `master` (commit `16b14001cf`) and created the `ui-rework` branch.
- Regenerated the Visual Studio build folder `MSVC2022_64` and built everything in RelWithDebInfo. All unit tests pass.
- Surveyed the engine for automation hooks, and researched how other projects let an agent drive a game or GUI. The findings are summarized in [harness.md](harness.md).
- Wrote the first versions of [plan.md](plan.md) and [harness.md](harness.md).

- The user approved the harness design. They also asked to run the unit tests at good stopping points rather than on every commit, and to review iteration speed every so often. [plan.md](plan.md) now says so.

Next: work through the order of work in [harness.md](harness.md).
